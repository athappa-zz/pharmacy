At a high level, my approach was first to read and process the CSV (`read_file`), after which I wrote the results to a file (`write_file`). More specifically, 

# Tests
As per the instructions, the assumption is that all data are properly formatted and that there are no missing values. 
1. `test_1`: Ordinary Functionality
2. `test_2`: A prescriber prescribes the same drug multiple times which should result in a count of 1 unique prescriber. 
3. `test_3`: Same prescriber prescribes different drugs which should count the prescriber twice.
